Launcher script for KOreader.

### Usage

Requires:
- KOreader installed as a KUAL extension

Install:
- Check that the paths I've set in the script work for your device.
- Unpack this project to /mnt/us/extensions/kols/
- The path is important, script will not operate from any other directory.
- Run tools->update PDFs to create an initial list

### Planned TODO

- Make the script more modular. Look for a reliable posix method of handling json from a shell script
- Include auto-updater (if I can figure out how to make one)
- Generate more intelligent naming scheme, rather than just the file name
- Allow customization of file extensions to include
- Include option to sort by alphabet or by usage counts

please send feedback to bigbero(at)gmail.com, unless there's a better system you'd rather use here on github.
